# Blockchain-based-Academic-Records-System

This is a Blockchain based Academic Record System which was developed by me, Shivam Goel and Kushagra Aggarwal as the Minor Project for 6th Semester course of our B.Tech.

The main program is in the "Minor Project" file and the "Clien" and "Serv" files help in the simulation of virtual nodes for the system.

The detailed description of the project and its functioning has been covered in the "Minor Project File".
